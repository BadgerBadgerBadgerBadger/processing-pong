# processing-pong

Two-player pong made with Processing.

This is a very old project (five or more years old). It's one of the first things I coded with [Processing](https://processing.org/). The only recent changes are the gradle files. I probably made a mess of that since I don't know anything about how gradle works.

You can play the game here [https://processing.org/](https://processing.org/)
